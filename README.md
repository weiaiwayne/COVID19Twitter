## Visualizing the Twitter discourse on COVID-19

My research team started collecting COVID-19-related tweets in late January, 2020, shortly after the lockdown of Wuhan, and weeks before the novel coronavirus was given the official name COVID-19. The hashtags we have been tracking include: _#CoronavirusOutbreak_, _#COVID19_, _#Coronvirus_, _#nCoV2019_, _#2019nCov_, _#WuhanCoronavirus_, _#CoronavirusChina_, _#CoronaVirusUpdate_, _#CoronavirusPandemic_, _#Wuhanvirus_, _#Wuhancoronavirus_, _#WuhanOutbreak_, _#Wuhanquarantine_, _#FlattenTheCurve_, _#COVID19US_, etc. Understandably, these are only a small part of all relevant hashtags; @jasonbaumgartne from Pushshift.io found over one million COVID-19-related hashtags [the list](https://files.pushshift.io/coronavirus_hashtags.txt).
